This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Divergences from the shared stack

wobbly is a **standalone library with zero runtime dependencies** — it uses none of tosijs,
tosijs-ui, or tosijs-schema, and has no UI, so the observant model doesn't apply here. It is
aligned with the stack on **Bun**, **TypeScript strict**, and the house Prettier config
(pinned to 2.8.8; single quotes, no semicolons).

There is **no ESLint** and **no doc site** — for a single-class library the README is the
documentation, and adopting `tosijs-ui/site` would mean taking a heavy devDep to render one page.

The npm package is **`wobbly-js`**, not `wobbly` — the bare name is taken on npm by an unrelated
react-vr package. The repo, the class, and the branding are still "wobbly".

## Commands

```sh
bun install
bun test                                           # run the suite (~2.6s)
bun test --test-name-pattern "outer tier reduce"   # run a single test by name
bun run typecheck                                  # tsc --noEmit (clean — keep it that way)
bun run format                                     # prettier --write .
bun run pack                                       # test + typecheck + bundle + .d.ts → dist/
```

Per `development.md`, there is deliberately **no `build` script** — `bun build` is a builtin, so a
script by that name would make `bun build` and `bun run build` mean different things. The full
build is `pack`, and `prepublishOnly` runs it.

Tests run under Bun because Bun supplies `Worker`, `Blob`, `URL.createObjectURL`, and
`navigator.hardwareConcurrency` — the same primitives the library needs in a browser. There is no
DOM test environment and none is needed.

## Architecture

`AsyncArray<T>` (`src/wobbly.ts`) is the entire public API: `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, and
`reduce`, each parallelized across a pool of Web Workers. Everything funnels through the private
`dispatch()`, which chunks the array, fans it out, and reassembles results by `workerIndex` — so
`map` and `filter` preserve input order.

### Callbacks are serialized, so closures do not exist

This is the constraint that shapes everything else. `dispatch()` sends `fn.toString()` to each
worker, which rebuilds it with `new Function('return ' + fn)()`. The callback therefore arrives in
the worker with **no closure** — any variable it referenced lexically is gone, and referencing one
throws `ReferenceError` inside the worker.

This bites in tests too: a callback may not call a module-scope helper, even one defined in the
same test file. Inline it.

Context comes from `.withContext(obj)`, which `JSON.stringify`s the object; the worker parses it
and `bind`s it as the callback's `this`. Consequences:

- Context-dependent callbacks must be `function` declarations, not arrows (arrows can't be rebound).
- Context must survive `JSON.stringify` — no functions, no class instances.
- `withContext()` is **immutable**: it returns a _new_ `AsyncArray` sharing the same array, so a
  context can't leak into unrelated operations on the same data.
- Array elements cross via `postMessage`, so they must be structured-cloneable.

### Two-tier reduce — the correctness landmine

`reduce` is the subtlest operation, and the only one that can be **silently wrong**. Each worker
folds its own chunk; the partials are then merged on the main thread. That means an
un-`combine`d reducer must be **associative**, or the answer is garbage with no error:
`[10,1,2,3].reduce((a, n) => a - n)` is `4` serially and something else through wobbly.

The fix, and the preferred API, is `reduce(fn, { combine })` — `fn` folds an item into an
accumulator (in a worker), `combine` merges two accumulators (on the main thread, so it _does_ have
a closure). Whenever the accumulator differs in shape from the items, these are necessarily
different operations, and `combine` is mandatory in practice.

`this.final` is the **legacy** path: with no `combine`, the partials are merged with the reducer
itself, bound to `final: true`. It still works (the `outer tier reduce` test covers it) but don't
reach for it in new code — it forces one function to do two jobs, and it can't be typed, since the
reducer's `item` is a `T` in the worker pass and a `U` in the final pass.

Workers call `data.reduce(processItem, undefined)` — no seed — so the accumulator starts
`undefined`. Reducers need a default parameter (`(acc = 0, item) => …`).

Because an empty chunk would reduce to `undefined` and poison the merge, `dispatch()` never hands a
worker an empty chunk: it clamps the worker count to the array length and releases the rest.

### Progress is automatic

`dispatch()` passes `reportProgress` to the worker only when the caller supplied a progress
callback; the worker then wraps the callback to count items and posts at ~1% intervals. The main
thread averages across workers and throttles to 1% deltas.

`this.progress()` still exists on the context as a **no-op**, purely so callbacks written against
the old opt-in API don't break. Don't call it in new code, and don't reintroduce manual counting —
it would double-count.

### Worker pool

The pool is built **lazily on first use**, not at import time. Keep it that way: importing the
library must not spawn threads or touch `navigator`/`Blob`, or it becomes unimportable under SSR.
For the same reason **never set `sideEffects: false`** in `package.json` (see `model-priors.md` —
it's a trap for libraries whose work happens at import).

`claimWorkers()` takes **half the pool** by default, so two concurrent operations overlap instead
of deadlocking behind each other — this is what the `filter should perform operations in parallel`
test exercises, and it's why a single operation gets ~5× on a 10-core machine, not ~10×.

Workers outlive a dispatch, so every listener `dispatch()` adds must come back off in `cleanup()`.
Without that, handlers accumulate on each pooled worker across operations. A worker that errors is
terminated and replaced rather than returned to the pool.
